Identify the types of data you'll need to collect. 

This could include:
    Student Data: 
        Demographics, grades, subjects taken, interests, etc.
    
    Academic Data: 
        Course syllabi, assignments, exam results, attendance, etc.
    
    External Data: 
        Job market trends, career requirements, etc.


    1. Academic Data:

        focuses on the courses, materials, and academic activities 0
        that the student interacts with, providing the basis for recommendations and performance predictions

        Course Data:
            The details about the courses a student has taken or is interested in will help the system suggest relevant subjects.

            Course Syllabi: Provides the course structure, topics covered, and learning objectives. This is important for matching students with appropriate courses based on their interests or academic needs.
            Prerequisites: Understanding course prerequisites can help in suggesting a logical learning path.
            Course Difficulty: Data on how challenging students find each course can help the system make recommendations based on a student's academic history and current performance.

    2. External Data:
        Job Market Trends:
            Information about job demand and salary trends for different industries can guide students toward career paths with strong growth potential.

            Industry Requirements: 
                Insights into what skills, certifications, and qualifications are needed for success in different fields (e.g., which coding languages are most in-demand for software engineers).

        Career Requirements and Qualifications:
            Data on the qualifications needed for different career paths will help guide students toward realistic career goals.

        Education Requirements for Jobs: 
            What educational background is necessary for various careers (e.g., a certain degree or specialization). This helps in shaping career guidance.

How to Use Public Data:

    Search for Datasets: 
        Use search terms like 
            “student performance,” 
            “course enrollment,” 
            “academic records,” 
            “education datasets,” and 
            “job market trends.”
    
    Check Licensing: 
        Ensure that the dataset you use is either in the public domain or available under an open license (e.g., Creative Commons).
    
    Preprocessing: 
        Many public datasets may require cleaning (handling missing data, normalization, etc.) before you can use them effectively.
