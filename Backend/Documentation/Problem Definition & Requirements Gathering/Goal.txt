4. Data-Driven Decision-Making for Educators

    Objective: 
        Provide academic advisors, counselors, and educators with data-driven insights to support their decision-making and improve their ability to guide students.
    
    Why it’s important: 
        Academic staff need actionable insights to effectively guide students. Data-driven decisions improve student outcomes and provide a clearer understanding of academic trends.
    
    What it should achieve:
        Present advisors with up-to-date academic performance data, at-risk student alerts, and overall trends.
        Assist educators in identifying which teaching methods or courses are more successful for different types of students.
        Help academic staff track student engagement, retention rates, and academic success.

    Mode: Chatboard
    Input: skills, interests + 
    Output: 
        Academic advisors, courselors, and aducators 
        (wih data-driven insights to support their decision-making to guide students)

5. Adaptive Learning and Continuous Improvement

    Objective: 
        Continuously adapt the AI system based on real-time student progress and feedback to improve the relevance of recommendations and predictions.
    
    Why it’s important: 
        The learning environment is dynamic. 
        What works for a student today may not work tomorrow. 
        A continuous learning loop allows the system to stay relevant.
    
    What it should achieve:
        Learn from student interactions, feedback, and performance to refine predictions and recommendations over time.
        Adjust learning paths, interventions, and recommendations dynamically as the system gathers more data about the student’s preferences, habits, and outcomes.

    Mode: Chatboard
    Input: interested_area, real-time student progress
    Output: 
        feedback to improve the relevance of recommendations and predictions

7. Scalability and Integration with Existing Educational Systems
    Objective: 
        Ensure the system can scale to accommodate a large number of students and integrate smoothly with existing educational infrastructures (e.g., learning management systems, student information systems).
    
    Why it’s important: 
        The system must be able to handle large amounts of student data and work with various platforms that educational institutions already use.
    
    What it should achieve:
        Seamlessly integrate with the institution’s existing databases, such as gradebooks, course catalogs, and student records.
        Support scalability to serve an increasing number of students without compromising performance.
        Allow easy integration with other educational tools (e.g., online courses, assignment management systems, etc.).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. Ethical and Transparent AI
    Objective: 
        Build a transparent, fair, and ethical AI system that takes into account privacy, bias mitigation, and the explainability of recommendations.
    
    Why it’s important: 
        The AI system will impact student lives, and transparency and fairness are critical for trust and equity.
    
    What it should achieve:
        Ensure student data is handled securely and in compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., FERPA, GDPR).
        Mitigate algorithmic biases to avoid unfair recommendations or predictions (e.g., ensuring the system does not favor specific groups based on demographic factors).
        Provide explanations for recommendations, predictions, and interventions so that students and educators can understand how decisions are being made.

    1. Predict Academic Performance and Interventions
        Objective: Predict student performance early in the semester or academic year and suggest interventions for students who may be at risk of underperforming.

        Why it’s important: Early identification of students at risk of failing allows academic advisors to intervene and provide support before it’s too late.

        What it should achieve:
            Accurately forecast grades and academic success using past performance, attendance, participation, and behavior.
            Identify at-risk students (e.g., low participation, late assignments, poor exam performance).
            Provide actionable recommendations, such as additional tutoring, study resources, or changes to learning strategies.
